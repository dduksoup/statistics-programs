# Mean, median, and mode

Given an array X of N integers, calculates and prints the respective mean, median, and mode on separate lines.  If array contains more than one modal value, prints the numerically smallest one.

Input format:
First line contains integer N, denoting the number of elements in the array.
Second line contains N space-separated integers describing the array's elements.

Sample input:

10

64630 11735 14216 99233 14470 4978 73429 38120 51135 67060

Sample output:

43900.6

44627.5

4978

# Weighted Mean

Given an array X of integers and an array representing the respective weights of X's elements, calculate and print the weighted mean of X's elements. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 31.0).

Sample input:
5

10 40 30 50 20

1 2 3 4 5

Sample output:
